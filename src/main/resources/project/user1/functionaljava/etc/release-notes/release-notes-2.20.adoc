= Release 2.20

Released: July 2009

The highlight of this release is a parallel module built on top of
actors for doing some very clever and high-level parallel programming.
e.g. An implementation of the parallel map/reduce algorithm
(parFoldMap) and APIs for making use of actors easier for you, the user.

Other new bits includes:

* A heap of bug fixes, particularly on Stream (and therefore, many of
its dependencies)
* LazyString -- a lazy sequence of characters
* Function Wrappers
* Improvements to the Tree and Zipper implementations
* Other tidbits and additional APIs

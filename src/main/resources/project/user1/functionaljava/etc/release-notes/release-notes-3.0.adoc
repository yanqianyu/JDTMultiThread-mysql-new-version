= Release 3.0

Released: Jun 2010

A crucial change has been made to the F interfaces, which are now abstract classes and containing useful methods. This means some other methods (fj.Function) are redundant and will be removed in a release soon (perhaps with a @Deprecated first).

There are other minor additions and bug fixes.
